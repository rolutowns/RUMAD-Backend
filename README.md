# RUMAD-Backend

This repository contains part of a project as a baseline for a matching sort of app, similar to Tinder. As of now, it contains the basic functionalities of creating a new user, with password encryption, as well as a way to connect to a front-end server. An efficient matching algorithm is currently in progress, as well as geolocation to better locate nearby users.
